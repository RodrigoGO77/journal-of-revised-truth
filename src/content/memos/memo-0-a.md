Following territorial acquisition, comprehensive asset enumeration was initiated to reduce fiscal uncertainty and consolidate administrative control. Surviving records indicate extraordinary scope and procedural rigor.

However, marginal annotations suggest selective underreporting in regions experiencing recent displacement. Patterns of inconsistent livestock valuation and fluctuating acreage declarations imply localized informational resistance. Enumeration reduces uncertainty, but does not eliminate it.

The record reflects both institutional ambition and human evasion. Total visibility remained aspirational.
